# base_project
A simple Dropwizard project serving as the base for adding on bits and pieces to build a full application.

Anyone is free to use this project as the starting point of their own. However, I do ask that you return 
credit to me for the work I have done and send me an email (matthewdoerksen.dev@gmail.com) just so I can 
stay informed regarding who is using this project (disclosing project details is NOT required).

Thanks!
Matt Doerksen (matthewdoerksen.dev@gmail.com)
