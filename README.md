# base_project
A simple Dropwizard project serving as the base for adding on bits and pieces to build a full application.

For a walkthrough of this project, its evolution and tutorials, please see http://restfuljavaforbeginners.weebly.com.

Releases (https://github.com/matthewdoerksen/base_project/releases) are tagged (and released) such that they include the incremental changes from past projects. They should follow the convention of major.minor.revision where:

1) Major changes cause breakage to occur between project versions. If this occurs, what breaks should be noted in the release notes (along with any workarounds, if necessary).

2) Minor changes include new features that do not break backwards compatibility (such as logging and an example of Lombok) in v1.1.

3) Revisions include minor bug fixes, comments, etc. not big enough to be included as a minor change.

Anyone is free to use this project as the starting point of their own. However, I do ask that you return credit to me for the work I have done and send me an email (matthewdoerksen.dev@gmail.com) just so I can stay informed regarding who is using this project (disclosing project details is NOT required).

Thanks!
Matt Doerksen (matthewdoerksen.dev@gmail.com)
